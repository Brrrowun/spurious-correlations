    "# Spurious Correlations\n",
    "***\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "This is a **short** *exploratory data analysis (EDA)* and *visualisation* of two random datasets. Even from this brief analysis, it is apparent that there are underlying issues within the datasets that would need further analysis and cleansing before serious, meaningful insights **could** and/or **should** be inferred. For further discussion on this see [Statistical Disclaimer Section](##statistical-disclaimer)\n",
    "\n",
    "Ofcourse, these data series are not completely random. I wanted them to have:\n",
    " 1. Interesting narrative potential\n",
    " 2. Minimize the need for data cleansing\n",
    " \n",
    "Which led me to picking:\n",
    "- Tesla Production\n",
    "    - [Available as estimates from Statista](https://www.statista.com/statistics/715421/tesla-quarterly-vehicle-production/)\n",
    "    - Total number of units sold\n",
    "- Nonfarm Business Sector: Real Output Per Hour of All Persons\n",
    "    - [Available from Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/OPHNFB)\n",
    "    - Taken as an index (100 being 2012 Q3)\n",
    "***    \n",
    "## Data\n",
    "Both time series datasets are exclusively in the range of 2012 Q3 to 2018 Q1.\n",
    "\n",
    "###   Tesla Production\n",
    "Given Elon Musk's tendency for secrecy around the inner-workings of Tesla, ([even after a press tour around a section of the manufacturing plant](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/elon-musk-tesla-model-3-problems-interview-today-2018-04-13/)) any specific data for Tesla is hard to come buy. Excluding the publically available financial information.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this reason my data source is based on estimates calculated from this financial information and fact-checked against Tesla press releases.\n",
    "    \n",
    "It represents the *Number of Produced Teslas* of any model since 2012 Q3.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Real Output per Hour\n",
    "Based on the measure from \"Nonfarm Business Sector: Real Output Per Hour of All Persons\", **Nonfarm** is defined by the U.S. Bureau of Labour Statistics (BLS) as:\n",
    "\n",
    ">... a subset of the domestic economy and excludes the economic activities of the following: general government, private households, nonprofit organizations serving individuals, and farms. \n",
    "\n",
    "In general then and in line with the exceptions stated above, it can be taken to be representative of *productivity per hour* in the U.S. economy.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Statistical Disclaimer\n",
    "As stated above, this exploratory analysis is by no means complete and still leaves questions unanswered in these datasets. When this task was given to me, I was told to: \n",
    "> - select two random data sets\n",
    "- undertake a correlation comparison and visualisation [on them]\n",
    "- add some brief documentation\n",
    "- spend no more than a few minor hours\n",
    "\n",
    "In light of the last point in particular, I have stopped myself from carrying out further tests in areas that I believe would require following for these insights to \"hold water\". This would include tests/solutions for:\n",
    "- The presence of unit roots within the data, which is common in many time series datasets. A good source of information can be found on [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unit_root) or [Michael's/Patrick's](https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/29121/intuitive-explanation-of-unit-root) answers should help for anywone interested in Unit Roots.\n",
    "- The presence of Heteroskedasticity within the data, shown in the *OLS Residuals* graph at the bottom of this document. This is non-constant variance across a time series, more information at [StatsMakeMeCry.com](http://www.statsmakemecry.com/smmctheblog/confusing-stats-terms-explained-heteroscedasticity-heteroske.html)\n",
    "- Non-Linear relationship will be fitted poorly by OLS, testing Non-Linear Regression model [alternatives](http://blog.minitab.com/blog/adventures-in-statistics-2/what-is-the-difference-between-linear-and-nonlinear-equations-in-regression-analysis)\n",
    "- Sum of Squared Errors (RSS) could also be fitting the model poorly even if the data is linear in its dispersion, more information on the OLS [Error Function](http://www.clockbackward.com/2009/06/18/ordinary-least-squares-linear-regression-flaws-problems-and-pitfalls/)\n",
    "- Presence of Autocorrelation within either datasets or their produced regression model, a simple explanation of which can be [found here](https://www.quora.com/What-is-autocorrelation)\n",
    "\n",
    "Given the data being utilised and inspite of these statistical shortfalls, there are plausible relationships to be found in the data. These can be found in the [Conclusion](##conclusion) section at the end of this notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Tools\n",
    "This notebooks stack is Python 3 and is being run inside of a virtual environment locally; specifically utilising virtualenv and virtualenvwrapper. Because of this there is no virtualenv file in this repo, instead I have created a requirements.txt file that can be used to install all dependancies required to run this notebook locally!\n",
    "\n",
    "In this EDA I have utilised *Cufflinks*, *Jupyter Notebooks* (no surprise!), *Pandas*, *Plotly*, and *Statsmodels*.\n",
    "\n",
    "Jupyter Notebooks was utilised to bring this style of interactive presentation, whilst  still allowing use of Markdown and code snippets. Pandas allows easy and powerful data utilisation and Statsmodels (perhaps not surprisingly) allowed for the running of **OLS** (Ordinary Least Squares) regression and neat presentation of standard output statistics. Cufflinks and Poltly are both visualisation packages which make utilisation of multiple other Python visualisation libraries much easier; such as Matplotlib and Seaborn."

    "The **const** represents the point at which the regression line crosses the y-axis and helps to collect some of the noise from a regression. It has few practical applications for inference and is predominately included to improve model performance, which is always good to work on!\n",
    "\n",
    "The coefficient of 5307.3116 for **Tesla Production** shows that for a every 1 unit increase in **Real Output per Hour**, there would be an extra 5307.3116 Tesla Vehicles produced. This is stated with a standard error of 512.923 is one standard deviation away from the estimate of the coefficient and a t-statistic of 10.071. This value with 22 Degrees of Freedom results in the coefficient being statistically significant for > p = 0.001, which is of a confidence interval greater than 0.1%.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Skew value of -0.579 shows that the regressions peak tends towards infinity, which is intuitive in this example given the previously discussed positive growth and fluctutations. Kurtosis of 2.385 shows how much of the variance is the result of infrequent extreme variations, but has not upper limit and so cannot be inferred from directly.\n",
    "So similar to Skew, Kurtosis is best used when compared relatively to other datasets or models.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, the Durbin-Watson statistic is a measure of autocorrelation from the residuals of a regression. It is measured between 0 and 4, where 2 would represent no autocorrelation, 0 and 4 representing autocorrelation in their positive and negative slopes respectively. Autocorrelation was previously discussed as a potential problem in my [Statistical Disclaimer](#statistical-disclaimer) and has turned out to be true. With a value of 1.034, the resultant model has strong positive autocorrelation which will have invalidated the previious findings I discussed.\n",
    "This can be accomodated for by utilising more complex models such as **ARMA**. A **ARIMA** model may be more pertinent though as this would also help to elimate the issues with heteroskedasticity and possible unit roots.\n",
    "\n",
    "The last two commands in the output save the models **'Fitted Values'** and **'Residuals'** into my pandas dataframe with their respective column names.\n",

I've also tried to point out throughout the workbook what direction to go in to make these results robust; even though they are likely to always be spurious given the nature of the datasets!\n",

    "The inference that Tesla Production, if the figures could be known directly from Tesla, could be a leading indicator of Real Output per Hour is plausible. Since the latter is released on the first Friday of the following month by the Bureau of Labour Statistics, there will usually be a lead on the Tesla data by a couple of days. Resulting in it being a potential predictor of USD($) Forex price estimation, given its large effect on the [financial markets](https://www.poundsterlinglive.com/usd/8831-us-dollar-eyes-non-farm-payrolls-and-wages-data-as-latest-trade-tensions-rile-markets).\n",
